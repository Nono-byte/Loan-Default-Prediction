Vehicle Loan Default Prediction
## Vehicle Loan Prediction Machine Learning Model Project Summary:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a vehicle loan holder defaulting on their payments. The model is built using a dataset containing historical vehicle loan data, including information such as applicant demographics, loan characteristics, and other features.

The project involves various machine learning techniques, including data exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and then evaluated on a separate portion to assess its performance.

Additionally, the project includes analyzing the results of the model to identify the most important factors contributing to loan default. This information can be used by lenders to make more informed decisions about loan applications and to develop strategies to mitigate the risk of default.

### Business Objectives
- The primary goal is to reduce credit loss by identifying risky loan applicants.
- By identifying these applicants, the company aims to minimize credit loss and improve portfolio and risk assessment strategies.
